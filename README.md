# Treeshrew pose estimation <img src="/README/logo.jpg" width="320px" align="right" />
We present a deep learning approach to achieve markerless pose estimation and recognize multiple spontaneous behaviors of tree shrews, including drinking, eating, resting, and staying in the dark house. This high-throughput approach can monitor the home-cage activities of tree shrews simultaneously over an extended period.This study provides an efficient tool to quantify and understand the natural behaviors of tree shrews.

## Requirements: 
* Windows on 64-bit x86 
* NVIDIA GPU (Tested on Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090)
* Python 3.8

## Get start: 
To run example:
```bash
